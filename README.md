# ChainerCV: a Library for Deep Learning in Computer Vision

ChainerCV is a collection of tools to train and run neural networks for computer vision tasks using [Chainer](https://github.com/chainer/chainer).

You can find the documentation [here](http://chainercv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Supported tasks:

+ Image Classification ([ResNet](examples/resnet), [VGG](examples/vgg))
+ Object Detection ([tutorial](http://chainercv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/detection.html), [Faster R-CNN](examples/faster_rcnn), [SSD](examples/ssd), [YOLO](examples/yolo))
+ Semantic Segmentation ([SegNet](examples/segnet), [PSPNet](examples/pspnet))
+ Instance Segmentation ([FCIS](examples/fcis),)

# Guiding Principles
ChainerCV is developed under the following three guiding principles.

+ **Ease of Use** -- Implementations of computer vision networks with a cohesive and simple interface.
+ **Reproducibility** -- Training scripts that are perfect for being used as reference implementations.
+ **Compositionality** -- Tools such as data loaders and evaluation scripts that have common API.

# Installation

```bash
$ pip install -U numpy
$ pip install chainercv
```

The instruction on installation using Anaconda is [here](http://chainercv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#install-guide) (recommended).

### Requirements

+ [Chainer](https://github.com/chainer/chainer) and its dependencies
+ Pillow
+ Cython (Build requirements)

For additional features

+ [ChainerMN](https://github.com/chainer/chainermn)
+ Matplotlib
+ OpenCV
+ SciPy

Environments under Python 2.7.12 and 3.6.0 are tested.

+ The master branch is designed to work on Chainer v4 (the stable version) and v5 (the development version).
+ The following branches are kept for the previous version of Chainer. Note that these branches are unmaintained.
    + `0.4.11` (for Chainer v1). It can be installed by `pip install chainercv==0.4.11`.
    + `0.7` (for Chainer v2). It can be installed by `pip install chainercv==0.7`.
    + `0.8` (for Chainer v3). It can be installed by `pip install chainercv==0.8`.

# Data Conventions

+ Image
  + The order of color channel is RGB.
  + Shape is CHW (i.e. `(channel, height, width)`).
  + The range of values is `[0, 255]`.
  + Size is represented by row-column order (i.e. `(height, width)`).
+ Bounding Boxes
  + Shape is `(R, 4)`.
  + Coordinates are ordered as `(y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max)`. The order is the opposite of OpenCV.
+ Semantic Segmentation Image
  + Shape is `(height, weight)`. 
  + The value is class id, which is in range `[0, n_class - 1]`.

# Sample Visualization

These are the outputs of the detection models supported by ChainerCV.
