# Example codes for Faster R-CNN

### Performance

| Training Setting | Evaluation | Reference | ChainerCV |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| VOC 2007 trainval | VOC 2007 test|  69.9 mAP [1] | 70.6 mAP |


### Speed

ChainerCV and Caffe (py-faster-rcnn) implementations run at almost the same speed.
We compared the time it takes to forward an image.

We compared `chainercv.links.FasterRCNN.__call__` and [Caffe's equivalent function](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn/blob/master/lib/fast_rcnn/test.py#L154).
We used [an image](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn/blob/master/data/demo/000456.jpg) from PASCAL VOC 2007 test split.
Our experiment was conducted on Ubuntu 14.04.5 with Pascal Titan X.

### Demo

If a path to pretrained model path is not given, weights distributed on the internet will be used.

```
$ python demo.py [--gpu <gpu>] [--pretrained_model <model_path>] <image>.jpg
```

This example will automatically download a pretrained weights from the internet when executed.
A sample image to try the implementation can be found in the link below.

### Difference in the runtime behaviour from the original code

The bounding box follows integer bbox convention in the original implementation, whereas the ChainerCV implementation follows float bbox convention used in COCO.
The integer convention encodes right below vertex coordinates of bounding boxes by subtracting one from the ground truth, whereas the float convention does not.

On top of that, the anchors are not discretized in ChainerCV.


### Train code

You can train the model with the following code.

```
$ python train.py [--gpu <gpu>]
```


### Evaluation

The evaluation score is reported by `DetectionVOCEvaluator` during training.
Also, the evaluation can be conducted outside of training loop by using [`chainercv/examples/detection/eval_voc07.py`](https://github.com/chainer/chainercv/blob/master/examples/detection).
