class FeaturePredictor(chainer.Chain):

    """Wrapper that adds a prediction method to a feature extraction link.

    The :meth:`predict` takes three steps to make a prediction.

    1. Preprocess input images
    2. Forward the preprocessed images to the network
    3. Average features in the case when more than one crops are extracted.

    Example:

        >>> from chainercv.links import VGG16
        >>> from chainercv.links import FeaturePredictor
        >>> base_model = VGG16()
        >>> model = FeaturePredictor(base_model, 224, 256)
        >>> prob = model.predict([img])
        # Predicting multiple features
        >>> model.extractor.pick = ['conv5_3', 'fc7']
        >>> conv5_3, fc7 = model.predict([img])

    When :obj:`self.crop == 'center'`, :meth:`predict` extracts features from
    the center crop of the input images.
    When :obj:`self.crop == '10'`, :meth:`predict` extracts features from
    patches that are ten-cropped from the input images.

    When extracting more than one crops from an image, the output of
    :meth:`predict` returns the average of the features computed from the
    crops.

    Args:
        extractor: A feature extraction link. This is a callable chain
            that takes a batch of images and returns a variable or a
            tuple of variables.
        crop_size (int or tuple): The height and the width of an image after
            cropping in preprocessing.
            If this is an integer, the image is cropped to
            :math:`(crop\_size, crop\_size)`.
        scale_size (int or tuple): If :obj:`scale_size` is :obj:`None`,
            neither scaling nor resizing is conducted during preprocessing.
            This is the default behavior.
            If this is an integer, an image is resized so that the length of
            the shorter edge is equal to :obj:`scale_size`. If this is a tuple
            :obj:`(height, width)`, the image is resized to
            :math:`(height, width)`.
        crop ({'center', '10'}): Determines the style of cropping.
        mean (numpy.ndarray): A mean value. If this is :obj:`None`,
            :obj:`extractor.mean` is used as the mean value.
