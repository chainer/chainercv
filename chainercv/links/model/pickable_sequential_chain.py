import chainer


class PickableSequentialChain(chainer.Chain):

    """A sequential chain that can pick intermediate layers.

    Callable objects, such as :class:`chainer.Link` and
    :class:`chainer.Function`, can be registered to this chain with
    :meth:`init_scope`.
    This chain keeps the order of registrations and :meth:`__call__`
    executes callables in that order.
    A :class:`chainer.Link` object in the sequence will be added as
    a child link of this link.

    :meth:`__call__` returns single or multiple layers that are picked up
    through a stream of computation.
    These layers can be specified by :obj:`pick`, which contains
    the names of the layers that are collected.
    When :obj:`pick` is a string, single layer is returned.
    When :obj:`pick` is an iterable of strings, a tuple of layers
    is returned. The order of the layers is the same as the order of
    the strings in :obj:`pick`.
    When :obj:`pick` is :obj:`None`, the last layer is returned.

    Examples:

        >>> import chainer.functions as F
        >>> import chainer.links as L
        >>> model = PickableSequentialChain()
        >>> with model.init_scope():
        >>>     model.l1 = L.Linear(None, 1000)
        >>>     model.l1_relu = F.relu
        >>>     model.l2 = L.Linear(None, 1000)
        >>>     model.l2_relu = F.relu
        >>>     model.l3 = L.Linear(None, 10)
        >>> # This is layer l3
        >>> layer3 = model(x)
        >>> # The layers to be collected can be changed.
        >>> model.pick = ('l2_relu', 'l1_relu')
        >>> # These are layers l2_relu and l1_relu.
        >>> layer2, layer1 = model(x)

    Parameters:
        pick (string or iterable of strings):
            Names of layers that are collected during
            the forward pass.
        layer_names (iterable of strings):
            Names of layers that can be collected from
            this chain. The names are ordered in the order
            of computation.
