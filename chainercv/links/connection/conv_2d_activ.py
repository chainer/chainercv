class Conv2DActiv(chainer.Chain):
    """Convolution2D --> Activation

    This is a chain that does two-dimensional convolution
    and applies an activation.

    The arguments are the same as those of
    :class:`chainer.links.Convolution2D`
    except for :obj:`activ`.

    Example:

        There are sevaral ways to initialize a :class:`Conv2DActiv`.

        1. Give the first three arguments explicitly:

            >>> l = Conv2DActiv(5, 10, 3)

        2. Omit :obj:`in_channels` or fill it with :obj:`None`:

            In these ways, attributes are initialized at runtime based on
            the channel size of the input.

            >>> l = Conv2DActiv(10, 3)
            >>> l = Conv2DActiv(None, 10, 3)

    Args:
        in_channels (int or None): Number of channels of input arrays.
            If :obj:`None`, parameter initialization will be deferred until the
            first forward data pass at which time the size will be determined.
        out_channels (int): Number of channels of output arrays.
        ksize (int or tuple of ints): Size of filters (a.k.a. kernels).
            :obj:`ksize=k` and :obj:`ksize=(k, k)` are equivalent.
        stride (int or tuple of ints): Stride of filter applications.
            :obj:`stride=s` and :obj:`stride=(s, s)` are equivalent.
        pad (int or tuple of ints): Spatial padding width for input arrays.
            :obj:`pad=p` and :obj:`pad=(p, p)` are equivalent.
        dilate (int or tuple of ints): Dilation factor of filter applications.
            :obj:`dilate=d` and :obj:`dilate=(d, d)` are equivalent.
        nobias (bool): If :obj:`True`,
            then this link does not use the bias term.
        initialW (callable): Initial weight value. If :obj:`None`, the default
            initializer is used.
            May also be a callable that takes :obj:`numpy.ndarray` or
            :obj:`cupy.ndarray` and edits its value.
        initial_bias (callable): Initial bias value. If :obj:`None`, the bias
            is set to 0.
            May also be a callable that takes :obj:`numpy.ndarray` or
            :obj:`cupy.ndarray` and edits its value.
        activ (callable): An activation function. The default value is
            :func:`chainer.functions.relu`. If this is :obj:`None`,
            no activation is applied (i.e. the activation is the identity
            function).
