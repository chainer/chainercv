    """Calculate the Intersection of Unions (IoUs) between bounding boxes.

    IoU is calculated as a ratio of area of the intersection
    and area of the union.

    This function accepts both :obj:`numpy.ndarray` and :obj:`cupy.ndarray` as
    inputs. Please note that both :obj:`bbox_a` and :obj:`bbox_b` need to be
    same type.
    The output is same type as the type of the inputs.

    Args:
        bbox_a (array): An array whose shape is :math:`(N, 4)`.
            :math:`N` is the number of bounding boxes.
            The dtype should be :obj:`numpy.float32`.
        bbox_b (array): An array similar to :obj:`bbox_a`,
            whose shape is :math:`(K, 4)`.
            The dtype should be :obj:`numpy.float32`.

    Returns:
        array:
        An array whose shape is :math:`(N, K)`. \
        An element at index :math:`(n, k)` contains IoUs between \
        :math:`n` th bounding box in :obj:`bbox_a` and :math:`k` th bounding \
        box in :obj:`bbox_b`.
