class DetectionVOCEvaluator(chainer.training.extensions.Evaluator):

    """An extension that evaluates a detection model by PASCAL VOC metric.

    This extension iterates over an iterator and evaluates the prediction
    results by average precisions (APs) and mean of them
    (mean Average Precision, mAP).
    This extension reports the following values with keys.
    Please note that :obj:`'ap/<label_names[l]>'` is reported only if
    :obj:`label_names` is specified.

    * :obj:`'map'`: Mean of average precisions (mAP).
    * :obj:`'ap/<label_names[l]>'`: Average precision for class \
        :obj:`label_names[l]`, where :math:`l` is the index of the class. \
        For example, this evaluator reports :obj:`'ap/aeroplane'`, \
        :obj:`'ap/bicycle'`, etc. if :obj:`label_names` is \
        :obj:`~chainercv.datasets.voc_detection_label_names`. \
        If there is no bounding box assigned to class :obj:`label_names[l]` \
        in either ground truth or prediction, it reports :obj:`numpy.nan` as \
        its average precision. \
        In this case, mAP is computed without this class.

    Args:
        iterator (chainer.Iterator): An iterator. Each sample should be
            following tuple :obj:`img, bbox, label` or
            :obj:`img, bbox, label, difficult`.
            :obj:`img` is an image, :obj:`bbox` is coordinates of bounding
            boxes, :obj:`label` is labels of the bounding boxes and
            :obj:`difficult` is whether the bounding boxes are difficult or
            not. If :obj:`difficult` is returned, difficult ground truth
            will be ignored from evaluation.
        target (chainer.Link): A detection link. This link must have
            :meth:`predict` method that takes a list of images and returns
            :obj:`bboxes`, :obj:`labels` and :obj:`scores`.
        use_07_metric (bool): Whether to use PASCAL VOC 2007 evaluation metric
            for calculating average precision. The default value is
            :obj:`False`.
        label_names (iterable of strings): An iterable of names of classes.
            If this value is specified, average precision for each class is
            also reported with the key :obj:`'ap/<label_names[l]>'`.
