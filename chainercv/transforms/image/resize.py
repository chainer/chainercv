    A bilinear interpolation is used for resizing.

    This method uses `cv2` or `Pillow` for the backend.
    If `cv2` is installed, it uses `cv2`. This backend is highly
    recommended because it is faster than `Pillow`. Under Anaconda environment,
    `cv2` can be installed by following command.
        $ conda install -c menpo opencv3=3.2.0

    If `cv2` is not installed, this method uses `Pillow`.

    Args:
        img (~numpy.ndarray): An array to be transformed.
            This is in CHW format and the type should be :obj:`numpy.float32`.
        output_shape (tuple): this is a tuple of length 2. Its elements are
            ordered as (height, width).

    Returns:
        ~numpy.ndarray: A resize array in CHW format.
