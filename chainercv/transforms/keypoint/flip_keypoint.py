    Args:
        keypoint (~numpy.ndarray): Keypoints in the image.
            The shape of this array is :math:`(K, 2)`. :math:`K` is the number
            of keypoints in the image.
            The last dimension is composed of :math:`x` and :math:`y`
            coordinates of the keypoints.
        size (tuple): A tuple of length 2. The height and the width
            of the image which is associated with the keypoints.
        x_flip (bool): Modify keypoints according to a horizontal flip of
            an image.
        y_flip (bool): Modify keypoints according to a vertical flip of
            an image.

        ~numpy.ndarray:
        Keypoints modified according to image flips.
