def resize_bbox(bbox, in_size, out_size):
    """Resize bounding boxes according to image resize.

    The bounding boxes are expected to be packed into a two dimensional
    tensor of shape :math:`(R, 4)`, where :math:`R` is the number of
    bounding boxes in the image. The second axis represents attributes of
    the bounding box. They are :math:`(y_{min}, x_{min}, y_{max}, x_{max})`,
    where the four attributes are coordinates of the top left and the
    bottom right vertices.

    Args:
        bbox (~numpy.ndarray): An array whose shape is :math:`(R, 4)`.
            :math:`R` is the number of bounding boxes.
        in_size (tuple): A tuple of length 2. The height and the width
            of the image before resized.
        out_size (tuple): A tuple of length 2. The height and the width
            of the image after resized.

    Returns:
        ~numpy.ndarray:
        Bounding boxes rescaled according to the given image shapes.
