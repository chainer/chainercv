def translate_bbox(bbox, y_offset=0, x_offset=0):
    """Translate bounding boxes.

    This method is mainly used together with image transforms, such as padding
    and cropping, which translates the left top point of the image from
    coordinate :math:`(0, 0)` to coordinate
    :math:`(y, x) = (y_{offset}, x_{offset})`.

    The bounding boxes are expected to be packed into a two dimensional
    tensor of shape :math:`(R, 4)`, where :math:`R` is the number of
    bounding boxes in the image. The second axis represents attributes of
    the bounding box. They are :math:`(y_{min}, x_{min}, y_{max}, x_{max})`,
    where the four attributes are coordinates of the top left and the
    bottom right vertices.

    Args:
        bbox (~numpy.ndarray): Bounding boxes to be transformed. The shape is
            :math:`(R, 4)`. :math:`R` is the number of bounding boxes.
        y_offset (int or float): The offset along y axis.
        x_offset (int or float): The offset along x axis.

    Returns:
        ~numpy.ndarray:
        Bounding boxes translated according to the given offsets.
