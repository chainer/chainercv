def flip_bbox(bbox, size, y_flip=False, x_flip=False):
    """Flip bounding boxes accordingly.

    The bounding boxes are expected to be packed into a two dimensional
    tensor of shape :math:`(R, 4)`, where :math:`R` is the number of
    bounding boxes in the image. The second axis represents attributes of
    the bounding box. They are :obj:`(y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max)`,
    where the four attributes are coordinates of the top left and the
    bottom right vertices.

    Args:
        bbox (~numpy.ndarray): An array whose shape is :math:`(R, 4)`.
            :math:`R` is the number of bounding boxes.
        size (tuple): A tuple of length 2. The height and the width
            of the image before resized.
        y_flip (bool): Flip bounding box according to a vertical flip of
            an image.
        x_flip (bool): Flip bounding box according to a horizontal flip of
            an image.

    Returns:
        ~numpy.ndarray:
        Bounding boxes flipped according to the given flips.
